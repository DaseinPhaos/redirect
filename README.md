# redirect

`redirect` aims to be a safe wrapper around the DirectX12 API for the Rust programming language.

## Why Bother

- folks want to work with D3D12
- the Win32 API is ugly to use directly, we want an elegant solution
- wrapping provides more safety guarantees

## What's Next

This is a pre 0.1 WIP.
Before 0.1, we should at least be able to draw a triangle on the screen safely and elegantly (i.e. rusty).
